# 📌Introduction

-A digital assistant, additionally known as an AI assistant or virtual assistant, is an utility application that is familiar with herbal language voice instructions and completes responsibilities for the person. The complete idea primarily based totally on how are we able to make our lifestyles simpler or how are we able to automate the matters via way of means of simply the use of our voice command. When the undertaking is being completed then to begin with it greets the person as according to the time. After that it simply pay attention your command in shape of voice and simply that that issue in step with your command.
  
-It is applied in “PYTHON Programming Language” wherein implementation could be very smooth. For each form of paintings there may be module found in python which makes the issue very smooth and powerful to do. It is person pleasant and smooth to comprehensible for beginner.

# 📌Moules/Libraries Used

### 🔸Pyttsx3
- A python library that will help us to convert text to speech. In short, it is a text-to-speech library.
- It works offline, and it is compatible with Python 2 as well as Python 3.

### 🔸Datetime
- To provide current or live time to Assistant.
- Used for greeting user according to time.

### 🔸Speech Recognition
- Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online and offline.

- Under most circumstances, simply calling the open() function from this module will do the right thing.

### 🔸OS
- The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
- This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.

### 🔸Random
- We can generate random numbers in Python by using random module.
- These are pseudo-random number as the sequence of number generated depends on the seed.

### 🔸PyAutoGui

# 📌WHY TO USE JARVIS?

1. It fulfils the own personnel desktop voice assistant.

2. It has an easy to install and use interface.

3. It accepts inputs even through voice or keyboard.

4. It automates tedious tasks like deployment, unit testing through a single command.

# 📌Advantages / Disadvantages 

|  **S.No.**  |  **Advantages**  | **Disadvantages**  |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|
|  **1.**  |  Secure |  Costly  |
|  **2.**  |  Easy to use |  Expensive equipments  |
|  **3.**  |  Custom commands  |  Limited language support  |
|  **4.**  |  Helpful for disabled ones  |  It cannot work in noisy environments  |
|  **5.**  |  Can't work with variety of commands  |  Can't use for more than one person at a time  |

# 📌Conclusion

- Through this voice assistant, we have automated various services using a single line command. It eases most of the tasks of the user like searching the web, retrieving weather forecast details, vocabulary help and medical related queries. 

- We aim to make this project a complete server assistant and make it smart enough to act as a replacement for a general server administration. The future plans include integrating Jarvis with mobile using React Native to provide a synchronized experience between the two connected devices. 

- Further, in the long run, Jarvis is planned to feature auto deployment supporting elastic beanstalk, backup files, and all operations which a general Server Administrator does. The functionality would be seamless enough to replace the Server Administrator with Jarvis.
